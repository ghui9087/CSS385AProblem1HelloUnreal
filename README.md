Due to the tutorial using the testing platform in the last two videos. So I have just created a New level for doing a basic Soccer game. The game only has the function of kicking the ball and when the ball hit the goal it was reset to the starting position. The Goal will push all objects out with 2000 N in the direction. 

If you open the project you get the error that shader Model 6 is missing in the setting. I deliberately did not set the shader model as it was too much to do for a Hello World Project.

Issue: 
The mouse can not follow the player view when your screen is small 720px.

Next step:
* Make the text disappear or by step on the button.
